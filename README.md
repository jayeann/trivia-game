## üéµüé¨ TriviaGuess

A guessing game where players try to guess the **song**, **TV show**, or **movie** based on a short clue or hint.

This project was built as a personal experiment to explore and play with modern frontend tools like **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Zustand**, **TanStack Query**, and **Firebase**. It‚Äôs a casual app with no pressure‚Äîjust practicing clean code and fun features.
